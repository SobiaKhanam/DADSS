### DATA ANALYSIS AND DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM

The DADSS project is a Django-based backend platform designed to support marine surveillance, policy-making, and operational decisions by analyzing real-time vessel movement data. It enables stakeholders to monitor vessel traffic, assess port activity, and identify patterns using structured filtering, historical trends, and automated insights. The system processes large-scale marine datasets and exposes them through RESTful APIs to feed into dashboards and visualizations.
